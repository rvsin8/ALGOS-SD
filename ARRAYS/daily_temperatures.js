You are given a list of daily temperatures, T, where each element represents the temperature of a single day. Your task is to return a list such that, for each day in the input, it tells you how many days you would have to wait until a you reach a day with a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead. For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72], your output should be [1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0].

Example(s)
